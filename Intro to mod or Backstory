  After defeating the Moon Lord, we believed that Terraria was free from otherworldly beings, from strange beasts, and crazed cults.
Now with the newfound power of the Celestial Binder, we are able to create new and amazing things. In the Olden Ages this very item 
was used by a god known as Vulcan, god of frie, volcanoes, metalworking, and forge. Now that you have released the power of 
these Celestial Binders, he is furious with you and wants to keep you from using its power for yourself and destroy it once and for all.
